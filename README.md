# Advanced Helm Demos
This is a collection of advanced Helm usage demos I built for a Config
Management Camp EU talk in 2020. They are meant to be relatively simple examples
that can show off some of the crazier things you can do with Helm. None of these
are of production quality but can serve as launching points for your own ideas.
See inside of each example directory for a README with instructions on how to
run that specific example
